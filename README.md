Data Science and Pure Maths @ University of Waterloo

## About 

Machine learning engineer & researcher with experience building AI-native products, researching generative AI algorithms and architectures (computer vision and natural language processing), and developing scalable backend systems. Also interested in general computer science, software engineering, and pure mathematics. 

## Experience 
* **Stealth Startup** -- Built backend for AI application from scratch, including agentic AI systems, knowledge retrieval systems, data generation and storage pipelines, and language model fine-tuning algorithms.
* **VIP Lab @ UWaterloo** -- Researched conditional diffusion models for the generation and super-resolution of high-quality wind dynamics.
* **Bradbury Group** -- Developed dynamic module-replacement tools for FLUX and Llama for efficient architecture search; researched stable pre-trained Transformer-based model distillation algorithms.
* **Unleash Networks** -- Machine learning for time-series analysis, prediction, and unsupervised anomaly detection for DoS/DDoS attacks.

I also work on various small-scale projects in AI engineering, LLM research, and neural network compute kernels.
