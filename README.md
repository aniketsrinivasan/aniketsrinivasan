# Aniket Srinivasan Ashok

Data Science and Pure Maths @ University of Waterloo

## About 

Undergraduate student with experience building AI products, researching ML algorithms and architectures, and developing scalable infrastructure. Interested in ML research/infrastructure and pure mathematics.

## Experience 
* **[Viggle AI](https://viggle.ai/about-us)** - Some product engineering, some algorithm design, and some data things. 
* **[CaseClock AI](https://caseclock.ai/)** — Built backend for AI application from scratch, including agentic AI systems, knowledge retrieval systems, data generation and storage pipelines, and language model fine-tuning algorithms.
* **[VIP Lab @ UWaterloo](https://vip.uwaterloo.ca)** — Researched conditional diffusion models for the generation and super-resolution of high-quality wind dynamics.
* **[Bradbury Group](https://bradburygroup.org/)** — Developed dynamic module-replacement tools for FLUX and Llama for efficient architecture search; researched stable pre-trained Transformer-based model distillation algorithms.
* **[Unleash Networks](https://www.trisul.org/blog/deep-learning-network-monitoring/)** — Machine learning for time-series analysis, prediction, and unsupervised anomaly detection for DoS/DDoS attacks.

I also work on various small-scale independent projects in AI engineering, LLM research, and neural network compute kernels.
